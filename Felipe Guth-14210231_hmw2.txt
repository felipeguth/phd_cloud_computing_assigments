Risk: The backup of data outside the company prevents the losing of data originated by random accidents, human failure or hardware failure.
Scalability: When more space is needed the DBA can scale the system in an easy and rapid way.
Maintenance: By using a cloud computing service all the maintenance of hardware, software and physical structure is executed by the provider if using a SaaS.  

Some disadvantages are:

If using IaaS: Manage all software installed in the infrastructure and the responsibility for maintaining all the software up to date.
Unwanted Access: Since the data is at a third-party company, there is no guarantee of the privacy of the information anymore.
