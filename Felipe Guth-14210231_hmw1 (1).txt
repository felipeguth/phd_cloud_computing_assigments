Which type of cloud services do Dropbox and Google Drive belong to (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS)?  Explain your answer.
Dropbox and Google Drive belong to the SaaS category. The users of these services consume a pre-built program that is offered as storage and sharing service.  The users of these applications do not have to configure and build a specific application based in a platform as in PaaS neither specify infrastructure for developing, running, and storing an app in cloud environments as in IaaS. They just make use of a Software as a Service: SaaS.
